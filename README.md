<h1>Movie trailer website for the Udacity Full-Stack Developer Nanodegree</h1>
This is my submission for review for the first project, a movie trailer website.  

<h4>Running the program:</h4>
1.  Download the files and place them all in the same directory.  
2.  Install Python
3.  Open your terminal of choice.
4.  Navigate to the directory where you placed the downloaded files
5.  Type the following into the command line:
      python entertainment_center.py
6.  The program should open up a web browser or a new tab.  Click on that window/tab.
7.  Look at the site!  You can scroll to a movie title, click on the poster image, and a
    Youtube video should pop out, showing you the movie trailer.  
    
Enjoy!
